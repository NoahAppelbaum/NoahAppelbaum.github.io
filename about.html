          Hi, I'm Noah!
        </p>
        <p>
          I to solve problems creatively and to learn new skills. These passions have led me to building software and
          developing for web in JavaScript and Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to pivoting into software development work, I spent many years as an actor, musician, and professional
          martial artist. Highlights of a wide-ranging career include performing motion capture for AAA video games,
          sword-fighting in front of thousands of people a night at the opera, and acting in a host of exciting and
          weird experimental theater productions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to performing, I have also taught as an instructor and curriculum developer for The Second City
          Training Center in Chicago, coached martial arts athletes to national-level medals, and worked with students
          of all ages learning to play musical instruments. I love sharing what I know, and helping others to realize
          their full potential!
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved my Intro to Java Programming class in high school, and my interest in programming and general
          terminal inquisitiveness led me to completing an introductory Java MOOC through the University of Helsinki
          while working as a performer. (Including several assignments completed in the dressing rooms at The Lyric
          Opera.) With an eye towards web development, I also started learning JavaScript. Several years into this
          journey, I have turned my focus to full-time web and software development. I am currently
          enrolled in a full-stack development bootcamp with RITHM School, expecting to graduate in December of 2023.
